## Request for Proposal

### Event

**Garden City Ruby Conference** is an international technical conference for programmers and developers dedicated to the Ruby programming language. This is the first regional Ruby conference in India, and the first of its kind to take place at Bangalore since 2011.

It will consist of 1 day of training programs, plus two days of the actual conference.

The event is backed by Innovation & Technology Trust (ITT). It is a public non-profit trust which was founded with the objective of providing a support system and networking between professionals in the field of emerging and open source technologies by bringing them together during workshops, seminars, and conferences.

### Sleeping Rooms

We estimate that we will require 10 sleeping rooms, from the night of 2 January 2014 to the night of 5 January 2014. Some will be used by international keynote speakers, and the rest by the event organizers & staff.

### Training Day

We will be providing one day of training programs to attendees. This will be on 3 January 2014. 

##### Infrastructure

We require four small rooms, each with an occupancy of 25 participants, seated classroom style. A/V services required would include sound, projector, power, wired & wireless internet in all four rooms. For audio input, each room should have one lapel microphone and one handheld microphone.


##### Catering
Thoughts?  
Is breakfast required?  
Is lunch required? 12:45 - 1:45 PM  
Who needs lunch? only training hosts? or participants too?  

A speaker dinner for the conference would take place, with about 90 attendees.
My count:  

*  ~ 20 speakers, including keynote
*  ~ 15 opportunity scholarship students
*  ~ 15 mentors for said students
*  ~ 20 sponsors
*  ~ 20 organizers

##### Schedule

9:30 AM - 12:30 PM: 2 or 3 or 4 tracks of half day training sessions  
2:00 PM - 5:00 PM: 2 or 3 or 4 tracks of half day training sessions  
7:00 PM - 10:00 PM: Speaker Dinner

### Conference Days

The actual conference will be held on 4-5 January 2014.

##### Infrastructure

Being a single-track event, we require one large hall, capable of seating 250 attendees theatre style. A/V services required would include sound, projector, power, wired & wireless internet. For audio input, this hall should have two lapel microphones and two handheld microphones. This will generally require a sound board as well.


##### Catering
Thoughts?  
Is breakfast required?  
Is dinner required on saturday? If so, for how many, and at what time?  
Is dinner required on sunday? If so, for how many, and at what time? We are already having drinks from 6 PM.

### General infrastructure requirements
Our event has some very specific and somewhat challenging needs regarding internet access and power. Because this is a programming conference, every single attendee will have a laptop and/or handheld device that they expect to be able to use all day, every day. We require access to power and high-speed internet all day for all our attendees in the conference and training rooms. We are very aware that we have very unique needs in this regard.
